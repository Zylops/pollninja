# Poll Ninja!
https://pollninja.netlify.app/

My first svelte app, which is a polling tool which is completely useless because: 

> 1. Completely on a local variable. This means as soon as you refresh all your polls and votes disappear.
> 2. Your friends cant vote on your polls, so if you're b a s e d you can just vote on polls yourself. DEMOCRACY!

I followed a tutorial series by the net ninja to get this done `=)`

Had some fun on it, learned quite a lot. I'm learning sveltekit next, shouldn't be hard. Might even learn to use databases and make this thing work.

Thanks for checking out this repo!
